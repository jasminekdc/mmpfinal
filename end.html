    <h1> Identifying </h1>
     
    <p>
        
Being able to identify and accept that you or another has an eating disorder can help in the recovery from an eating disorder.

<p> In order to identify eating disorders, ignore the poor representation the media provides when talking about eating disorders. </p>

<p>Do not assume that just because you or others aren’t severely underweight that means you aren’t capable of having an eating disorder. Once you realize this, you will have an easier time recognizing disordered behaviors in the people around you. Pay attention to a preoccupation with weight others or yourself might have and weird or confusing behaviors others might exhibit when the topic of food arises. </p>
    
<p> Recognize that the image of a young, anorexic female is not the poster image for eating disorders. People of color and men often find trouble in pursuing treatment because of this stigma.  </p>
