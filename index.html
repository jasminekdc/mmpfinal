When people think of an eating disorder, the image of a thin young woman is what comes to mind. A woman who counts calories and consumes very little amounts of food. This is harmful, as it erases and can invalidate the people who do not fit this description but deal with eating disorders. 

<p> In the United States, around 20 million women and 10 million men are struggling or struggled with an eating disorder. They could be people present in your life. Your loved ones are not all a thin young woman struggling with Anorexia. Eating disorders can manifest in a myriad of ways, and itâ€™s important to acknowledge this to come to a better understanding of the disorder and who may suffer from it. </p>
